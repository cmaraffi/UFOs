## Overview of Project: UFO Finder

The overview of this project is build a webpage that will filter UFO sightings utilizing JavaScript and HTML. Creating this page for Dana regarding a detailed analysis based on multiple criteria.

### Purpose:
This project for Dana delves deeper into the world of UFOs. With unidentified flying objects there is some mystery surrounding those sightings. With this webpage anyone can filter and search, based on the options, for anywhere and file UFO sightings. 

### Results: 

The overall project was very interesting in building the javascript code and understanding the differences in structure from Python. Once I understood the differences and basic structure, it became more apparent how to expand on that knowledge. The app.js file does have some complexities in it with filtering data and the building the behind the scenes aspect to Dana's webpage. HTML is a completely different exercise in the sense that it has it's own nuances and keywords. I would say the actually building out the webpage versus javascript, was an more direct process. It has its own version of open and closed brakets with <>. The completed webpage has multiple filters which makes it easier for the user and fun graphics which add that additional element of fun and mystery surrounding the subject of UFOs. 


### Summary: 

While I am very excited about the page, it does not have a live update or live data pull so it wont update with any new sightings until the data.js updates. The webpage provides details on Date of occurance, city, state, country, shape, and comments around the sighting. This gives the searcher a multitude of options in the quest. The structure of the page itself also provides a sense of community because there is the sense that, you are not alone in the universe with this page. There are a few images to show how to filter the data and find what you might search for.

#### Two Recommendations: 
It would be fun to have a option for places with the top 10 sightings of all time. Another recommendation that might be interesting to UFOlogists to have a map and oncorporate pins to the locations to provide a visual in case someone is planning a trip and wants to hit some major sights. Another option would be to search in the comments for commonalities. It could support a theory someone is pursuing for similarities around different locations.
